# Azure_PowerBI_Sales_Report_Project
This project showcases skills learned during an Azure Data Fundamentals week, where I explored:

- Relational data in Azure SQL Database
- Non-relational data in Azure Cosmos DB / Storage
- Analytics and reporting using Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI

Since the virtual machine environment is no longer accessible, this repository focuses on the Power BI Sales Report created during the labs, supported by explanations of the Azure services involved.

## **Data Flow:**

- Querying using SQL

Non-Relational Data
- How semi-structured data is stored in Azure Storage (Blob, ADLS)
- Basic concepts of NoSQL and Cosmos DB

Analytics in Azure
- Using Synapse Studio to explore and transform data
- Using Power BI to visualise cleaned datasets

## **Tools Used**

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2)
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Power BI Desktop
- Visual Studio Code / Azure Portal
